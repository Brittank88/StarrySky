## About Starry Sky

Starry Skies is a Minecraft mod for the fabric mod loader that adds 3 dimensions with that name. It can be seen as a modern revamp of the "planetoids" world generator by Seibai for Minecraft 1.2.5 back in 2012 - although a lot more extensive and with mod support.



## Features

The mod adds 3 new dimensions: The Starry Sky (Overworld equivalent), Scary Sky (Nether) and Scarcy Sky (End).

The Starry Sky dimensions consist out of never ending floating spheres floating in the sky. They can be filled with precious ores or dungeons. But watch out! If you're careless you could very well burn in lava.


## Entering the Starry Sky dimension

Build a **portal out of packed ice** and light it with flint & steel. [can be configured in the config].
The other dimensions are accessed like their vanilla counterparts: Via nether and end portals, respectively.

If you want to start in the Starry Sky go ahead! The mod "GlobalSpawn" can be used to set "starry_sky:starry_sky" as your spawn dimension.
At x:16 y:90 z:16 will always be a wooden sphere, so that will be a great starting point for your adventure.

**WARNING:** Due to how custom dimensions are currently implemented by Mojang custom dimensions are only loaded after the second server start!

## Configuration

You're able to configure how many spheres generate and how much room should be mandatory between each sphere. Also the ground: Fall safely into water, burn the inventory in lava, or fall into the void? Your choice.

Each sphere pack (besides vanilla) can be enabled / disabled. There is also an optional Pride pack if you like it.
